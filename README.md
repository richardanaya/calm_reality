A list of resources dedicated toward those seeking a calm existance with cutting-edge techology.

# Philosophy

This list started as a countereaction to an observance of trend of increasing forms of stimulating technology.  A transition of market interest from computers, to phones, to virtual reality, to augmented reality, to mixed reality.  I felt unsatisfied with the direction of technology leading me away from a life with a calm reality.  I hope this resource can help you find the quietude your mind needs to enjoy all life has to value.
